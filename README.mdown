Information
===========

This is personal settings repo to share my bash aliases and custom functions between servers. Please see .bashrc.sample to get idea on how to use this approach.

   mkdir ~/etc
   git clone git://github.com/dreamiurg/bash-ext.git ~/etc/bash-ext
   cat ~/etc/bash-ext/.bashrc.sample >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
