Information
===========

This is personal settings repo to share my bash aliases and custom functions between servers. Please see .bashrc.sample to get idea on how to use this approach.

    git clone git://github.com/dreamiurg/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
    sh ~/.dotfiles/git-setup.sh
