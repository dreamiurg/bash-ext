Information
===========

This is personal settings repo to share my bash aliases and custom functions between servers. Please see .bashrc.sample to get idea on how to use this approach.

    mkdir ~/etc
    git clone git://github.com/dreamiurg/bash-ext.git ~/etc/bash-ext
    sh ~/etc/bash-ext/install.sh
